                    <h2>Petra,Jordan</h2>
                                <p>Petra comes from the ancient Greek “Petros,” meaning “rock,” which is a boring name for a very not boring place. Petra is in the south of Jordan. It’s believed to have been established around 300 BC.

                     <p>Found in the Yucatán state, Chichén Itzá is a massive Mayan city that was once a powerhouse in
                         the area. Its heyday was from around 600 AD to 1200 AD, and its name translates to “at the
                         mouth at the well of Itza.”

                        <p>The Taj Mahal is a labor of love. Emperor Shah Jahan built it in honor of his favorite wife,
                            Mumtaz Mahal, who bore 14 children but died in labor. Jahan was lost without her,he began construction on what is probably the world’s most elaborate and expensive
                            mausoleum.
